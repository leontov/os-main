# Kolibri OS Release Plan

## Vision
Kolibri OS aims to deliver a lightweight, reliable, and scriptable operating environment with first-class support for KolibriScript applications and embedded simulators. The release will provide developers with a cohesive toolchain, validated runtime, and comprehensive documentation so that they can build and deploy Kolibri workloads confidently.

## Guiding Principles
- **Stability first:** prioritize deterministic builds, reproducible simulations, and regression-free releases.
- **Developer ergonomics:** streamline scripting, testing, and deployment workflows.
- **Cross-platform reach:** maintain support for native, WebAssembly, and embedded targets.
- **Transparent quality:** enforce automated checks, coverage, and policy validation across the stack.

## Milestones and Deliverables

### 1. Tooling Foundation (Week 1)
- Finalize dependency manifests (`requirements.txt`, CMake targets) for CI cache warmup.
- Ensure `ruff`, `pyright`, and `pytest` pass locally; add missing type stubs or suppressions.
- Harden `ks_compiler` build by validating CMake configurations for native and WASM outputs.
- Document local setup in `README.md` including bootstrap scripts and environment prerequisites.

### 2. Simulator Hardening (Weeks 2-3)
- Complete type coverage for `core/kolibri_sim.py` and related scripts.
- Expand unit tests in `tests/test_kolibri_sim.py` to cover soak scenarios and journal rollovers.
- Profile performance hotspots and add benchmarks for event processing.
- Introduce structured logging and trace toggles for debugging complex simulations.

### 3. Script Runtime Enhancements (Weeks 3-4)
- Align C and Python bindings for KolibriScript APIs; ensure shared buffer semantics.
- Add regression tests in `tests/test_script.c` and integration harnesses under `scripts/`.
- Implement scripting examples demonstrating digits, networking, and soak workloads.
- Provide developer documentation for extending KolibriScript with custom modules.

### 4. Frontend & User Experience (Weeks 4-5)
- Polish web frontend (if applicable) to visualize simulation metrics and digit streams.
- Integrate real-time updates via WebAssembly build artifacts.
- Collect user feedback through internal testing sessions and iterate on UX pain points.

### 5. Release Readiness (Week 6)
- Freeze features, enter bug-fix-only mode, and triage outstanding issues.
- Achieve policy compliance and security review sign-off.
- Finalize release notes, changelog, and migration guides.
- Tag release candidate builds, perform regression suite, and publish final artifacts.

## Risk Management
- Establish weekly checkpoints to track milestone progress and unblock dependencies.
- Maintain contingency buffers for integration regressions or CI instability.
- Use feature flags to isolate experimental functionality from release-critical paths.

## Post-Release Follow-Up
- Monitor telemetry and crash reports for two weeks post-release.
- Schedule retrospective to capture lessons learned and update processes.
- Plan maintenance releases for critical fixes and incremental improvements.

## Success Metrics
- 100% pass rate across CI matrices (Python, CMake, WebAssembly, policy checks).
- Code coverage above 80% for critical modules; no regressions in soak benchmarks.
- Positive developer feedback collected via survey on tooling and documentation quality.
